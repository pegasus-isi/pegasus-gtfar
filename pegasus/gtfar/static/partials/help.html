        <p>The help resources for the science behind GTFAR are coming soon.</p>
        <h3 id="webInterface"> Using the Web Interface</h3>
        <p>The web interface provides an organized way for you to create and monitor runs for your workflows.</p>
        <h4 id="viewRuns">Viewing Runs</h4>
        <p>The default page you will be taken to the page that lists all of the runs.  At any time you can get back to this page by clicking the Home icon at the top menu.
        Here you will be able to see all runs listed in order of most recently created to least recently created.  You can sort the list however you like by clicking the headers at the top of the table.
        You can also search for a specific run by clicking the triangle icon at the top right corner of the table, and then entering your query into the box that appears.
        To view the details of any page, click on the name of the run that you want to inspect.  The details page will open up to show you what parameters were input into the run when it was created, how far along the run is progress, how many failures have been detected, and what output files are available for download.
        On the details page you can download files by clicking on the name of the file.</p>
        <h4 id="newRun">Creating a New Run</h4>
        <p>There are two ways to get to the page to create a new run.  Your first option is to click the GTFAR dropdown menu at the top and then click
        "Start New Run".  Your second option is to click the "Start New Run" button at the listing page.</p>
